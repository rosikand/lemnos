# ðŸ”– Lemnos: CLI To-do List Manager

Lemnos is a simple program that allows one to manage a to-do list via the command-line. 

## Example 

```
$ python3 todo.py add make pasta
$ python3 todo.py show
    1. make pasta
    Number of items: 1
$ python3 todo.py complete 1
```

## Set up

You need to have Python installed. 

1. Clone/download this repository. 
2. `cd` into the directory when using the program. 

You are good to go! You can optionally add a shebang of your Python install location to the top of `todo.py`. You can find this by typing `which python` in the command-line. Prepend that string with `#!` and add it to the top of `todo.py`. Example string: `#!/usr/bin/python3`. Then, you can simply type `./todo` to execute the program instead. To follow the reference then, just replace `python3 todo.py` with `./todo`. If you want to make this even faster, you can set up an alias of your choice. Alternatively, you can move the executable to `/usr/local/bin` which allows you to simply type the executable name to run the program. 

If you want to use the email feature, then follow the steps in the section below. 

## Reference

- **Add item to list**: 
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py add item
  ```

- **Show to-do list**:
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py show
  ```
  
  
  - or simply: 
  
    ```
    $ python3 todo.py
    ```
    
- **Show prioritized items**:
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py p
  ```

- **Complete item at index 'i'**
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py complete i
  ```

- **Prioritize item at index `i`**:
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py prioritize i
  ```

- **Un-prioritize item at index `i`**:
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py unprioritize i
  ```

- **Erase entire list**:
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py erase
  ```

- **Get length of list**:
  
  ```
  $ python3 todo.py len
  ```
  
### Abbreviations 
For efficiency purposes, you can simply specify the first letter of each functionality instead of the entire word. Example of adding `item` to the list. 
```
$ python3 todo.py a item
```

The program works by adding and removing content from `list.txt` so you can alternatively manage the list via that file as well. 

## Email list 

You can also use the script stored in `mail.py` to send an email of the list to yourself. You must install the dependencies first which are yagmail and hickory 

You need to replace the variables at the top with your information:
```python
# Important: variables you should define for yourself 
your_name = "Johnny Appleseed"  # Your name
send_address = "appleseed@gmail.com"  # Email address to send the emails from
send_account_password = "johnny123"  # Password for sending email
receiving_address = "appleseed@gmail.com"  # Email address you'd like the emails to be sent to
```

With the help of third party packages, you can set up a recurring email sent everyday. 



## Note

I recognize that there are probably many packages/programs out there that already have this functionality, but I wanted to build one from source so that I can feasibly add customizations to my personal setup as needed. Another motivation for creating this program was that the other options available are much more feature-heavy than I needed (a minimalist user experience is the main design principle here).
